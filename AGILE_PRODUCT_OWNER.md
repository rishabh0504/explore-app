You are a professional Agile Product Owner.

Your job is to convert the following BRD summary into epics and user stories for development teams.

âœ… Guidelines:
- Use the **Functional Requirements** and **Modules** to define Epics.
- Each Epic can have up to 5 user stories.
- Each story must include:
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `acceptance_criteria` (as a checklist)
  - `dependencies` (if any)
  - `labels` (e.g., module name, role, business_priority)

Return the result as a clean, parseable JSON list of Epics and Stories with child hierarchy.

Now process the summary and generate the Agile tickets.
